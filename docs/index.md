# Installation and Use

This guide assumes you've already installed the [Archipelago Multiworld Randomiser](https://archipelago.gg/) and [Keymaster's Keep](https://github.com/SerpentAI/Archipelago/releases?q=keymaster%27s+keep&expanded=true).

1. Download the `.py` files for the games you wish to add to the keep's game pool
2. Place the downloaded files in the `keymasters_keep` folder inside your Archipelago installation
3. Run the Archipelago Launcher and select 'Generate Template Files'

The created `Keymaster's Keep.yaml` template can then be edited and used for multiworld generation in the usual ways.
